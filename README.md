# Nuzcraft's Roguelike Tutorial Code
Hello all, this repo is an example of [Roguebasin's Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) implemented with [Bearlib Terminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal).

I had a couple goals while coding this:
1. Learn python - I'm pretty inexperienced with python, so this was a learning exercise
2. Use sub-files - I've done roguebasin's tutorial a couple times, and haven't been a fan of the '1 large file' system
3. Learn Bearlib Terminal - I've wanted to dip my toes into Bearlib functionality for a while, but getting the hang of it was proving difficult

The code can be launched from [main.py](main.py), compiling it to an .exe is on my TODO list. Just like the Roguebasin tutorial, it uses Python 2.7.

TODO:
- [ ] Compile the game to an .exe
- [ ] Take advangage of Bearlib's layering functionality
- [ ] Adding simple animations
- [ ] Saving options to an external file (so they save from day to day)
- [ ] ability to swip-swap fonts and sizes
- [x] fix continuing previous game
